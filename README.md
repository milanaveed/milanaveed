### Hello, I'm Mila 👋

Currently doing a Master's degree in Software Engineering at The University of Western Australia, graduating in June 2026.

-   🔗 This is my [space](https://littledatastructure.quora.com/) and [website](https://littledatastructure.netlify.app/) where I document my practice with data structures
- 👩🏻‍💻 I hope to leave something useful before I become ashes 🏃🏻‍♀️

### My past projects are as follows:
🚢 [Battleship](https://github.com/milanaveed/cits3002-labs/tree/main/22756463_BEER) - My multi-threaded two-player battleship game in the Computer Networks unit, where I practised interactive design, modularity and completed high-level tasks within a very limited amount of time. 

🖥️ [High Performance Computing] - An assignment of the CITS5507 HPC unit (parallelism). A collaboration between Zachary and me, where Zachary wrote the raw code in C using OpenMP and described the parallel structures, I was in charge of testing/debugging in both local and Pawsey environments and analysing the performance. Received 100 out of 100.

☁️ [Cloud Computing](https://github.com/milanaveed/cits5503) - Assignments of the CITS5503 Cloud Computing unit. Amazon Web Services, Linux, Docker, DynamoDB, Django.

📖 [NLP - ABSA Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LDM0aTeyFniUW042YhCcsw_4O9wiMnvn/view?usp=sharing) - An Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis research project in the Natural Language Processing unit, which featured a novel design, high model performance, and good representation. Received all three bonus marks for the assignment.

🤖 [Machine Learning](https://github.com/milanaveed/cits5508/blob/main/assignment2/assig2_22756463.ipynb) - Assignment 2 of the CITS5508 Machine Learning unit with a grade of 96%. No use of AI-powered tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.

🍄 [AI & Super Mario Bros](https://github.com/milanaveed/cits3001_project) - Implementation of unsupervised machine learning (reinforcement learning using Stable Baselines and PyTorch).

🐜 [Active Inference & Ant Colony Simulation](https://github.com/milanaveed/cits4403_project) - Agent-based model written in Python that explores metrics for evaluating the presence of Stigmergy.

🔐 [Secure Coding in C](https://github.com/milanaveed/cits3007_project) - CITS3007 Secure Coding project, received two bonus marks for taking care to avoid integer overflow and bad values to `calloc`.
